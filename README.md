#Wireless communication protocol using parity check and checksum [ASK modules]
  
  This project aims to provide a unidirectional digital communication protocol, designed for applications requiring reliability and stability in the received information. Therefore, the chosen approach involves designing a model with a high load of redundant information for error detection.
  As a test model, communication between two Arduino microcontrollers is proposed. A potentiometer is connected to the transmitter to regulate the intensity of an LED connected to the receiver  
  FS1000A modules are chosen for the transmitter, and XY-MK-5V modules for the receiver. OOK 433MHz.

  In my blog you'll find the detailed explanation about this code.
